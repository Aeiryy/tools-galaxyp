Description
-----------

iQuant is a tool that performs tag based isobaric quantification by implementing a technique assigning collective reporter ion intensity-based weights to each peptide abundance ratio and calculating a protein's weighted average abundance ratio and p-value.

iQuant requires identification results from an upstream identification pipeline along with XML peak lists for the data (mzXML is well supported and an mzML option has been provided for testing).

More information about iQuant can be found in its paper <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20821806>.
